rushabh-github/rushabh-github is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

There are some more private repos where I have python scripts and bash scripts (for certain automation) but they are purely for cryptos derivatives and nifty derivatives(OI chain handlers). Mail me if you know more.
